# ⚠️ LEGAL NOTICE - Question Import Guidelines

## Copyright and Licensing

### ❌ DO NOT USE:
1. **Exam Dumps** - Actual exam questions leaked/shared illegally
2. **Paywalled Content** - Content behind subscription/payment walls
3. **Unlicensed Repos** - GitHub repos without clear open-source license
4. **Proprietary Content** - Questions owned by certification vendors

### ✅ SAFE TO USE:
1. **Official Free Samples** - Practice questions provided by vendors
2. **MIT/Apache Licensed Repos** - Clear open-source license
3. **CC-BY Licensed Content** - Creative Commons with attribution
4. **User-Generated Content** - Original questions created by community

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Official Practice Tests (100% Safe)
- AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/ (Free sample questions)
- Azure: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/ (Free practice assessment)
- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/ (Official tutorials)

### Option 2: Create Original Questions
- Generate questions from official documentation
- Create based on real-world scenarios
- Use AI to help write (but review for accuracy)

### Option 3: Licensed Content Providers
- Partner with exam prep companies
- Purchase bulk question licenses
- Commission question writers

## Action Items

1. **Verify License** - Always check LICENSE file before using any repo
2. **Attribute Sources** - Give credit to original authors
3. **Respect ToS** - Follow terms of service of all sources
4. **Quality Check** - Verify accuracy of all questions
5. **Legal Review** - Get legal approval for large imports

## Current Status

Most GitHub "exam prep" repos are **legally questionable** because:
- No clear license file
- Likely contain actual exam questions (copyright violation)
- May violate certification provider ToS
- Could result in legal action or certification ban

**Recommendation**: Focus on creating original questions or using official free resources.
